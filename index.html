    <p>I would like to introduce myself to you, my name is Koffi Becanty. 
       I am originally from Ivory Coast, but I come from Ukraine. 
       We moved to the USA not so long ago. 
       I speak 3 languages, two of them fluently (French and Russian) and also English which I am still learning.
       I am challenging myself to get a degree in the USA.
      At the moment I am in the Computer Science ASS at Renton Technical College with the goal of getting my BAS.
     <p>  
    </p> I've been a huge soccer fan since I was a kid, and I'd love to learn about and work on technology in soccer. 
      It's really a field I'm passionate about...<br>
      - Technology-enhanced players and Training<br>
      - How technology improves the game<br>
      - Player health monitoring<br>
      - How will football change in the decades ahead ?<br>
      And more ...
